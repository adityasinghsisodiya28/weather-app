# weather-app

"Excited to share the latest project I've been working on during my web development internship at Prodigy Infotech - a sleek and intuitive weather app! ðŸŒ¦ 

This project challenged me to utilize my skills in frontend and backend development to create a seamless user experience while delivering accurate weather forecasts. From designing the user interface to implementing APIs for real-time data, every step has been a valuable learning experience.

Special thanks to the amazing team at Prodigy Infotech for their guidance and support throughout this journey. Can't wait to continue honing my skills and contributing to more innovative projects in the future! #WebDevelopment #Internship #ProdigyInfotechÂ #WeatherApp"
